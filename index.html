        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent Motorwagen.[3][4][5] Cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[6] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[7] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
          elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
          purposes bysupplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document
            Object Model
            (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
            respond
            to user
            events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For
            example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of
            information
            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What you should already know</h3>
        <p>The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot".</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. 
          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>SIn Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41 per cent of total British car production. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hello world- Javascript</h3>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
          code:</p>
        <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</p>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
