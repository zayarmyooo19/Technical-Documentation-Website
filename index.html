        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a
          host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment
          to
          provide
          programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
          elements
          such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
          purposes
          by
          supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document
            Object Model
            (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
            respond
            to user
            events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For
            example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of
            information
            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hello world</h3>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
          code:</p>
        <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</p>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
